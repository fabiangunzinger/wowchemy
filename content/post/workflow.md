## Python and environment management

- I'm currently using `conda`, but find it a bit clucky and slow, and have been
  thinking about moving to an alternative like pyenv (for managing Python
  version), pipenv, or poetry. But I don't understand how they relate to one
  another, so need to to this if I want to switch.
