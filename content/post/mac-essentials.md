Notes on my mac setup.

## Notes backup

- All my notes are stored and backed up in iCloud. Because I rely on them so
  heavily, I also want an additional backup stored in Time Machine. To do this,
  use an Automator script called Run AppleScript from
  [this](https://bear.app/faq/Import%20&%20export/Migrate%20from%20Apple%20Notes/)
  that exports each note as an HTML and stores them in a folder.


## Keyboard shortcuts

- To "un-minimise" an application (i.e. undo the effect of `cmd-m`), use
  `command-shift` shortcut to navigate to application and then, with the
  application selected, press `option` and release `command`.
