I am a behavioural and data scientist and use methods from data science and
econometrics to elicit behaviour traits from large-scale datasets to better
understand human behaviour and -- ultimately -- help built great tools that
help people achieve their goals.

I've worked on topics in political economy, development economics, health
economics, and financial economics. In my PhD research I use transaction-level
data to better understand how people save.
