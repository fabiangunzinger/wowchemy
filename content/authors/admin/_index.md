Hi there, and thank you for visiting! I'm a behavioural and data scientist who
uses large datasets, insights from behavioural science, and methods from
econometrics, causal inference, and machine learning to study human beahviour
in the wild. The scientist in me loves doing this to further knowledge; the
craftsman in me, to help build great products.
