I use methods from econometrics and machine learning, insights from behavioural
science, and large datasets to study human behaviour in the
wild. The scientist in me does this to further knowledge and understanding; the craftsman in me, to help build great products.

In the past, I have worked on topics in political economy, health and financial
economics. In my current PhD research, I use transaction-level data to study
how people spend and save money.
