I use methods from econometrics and machine learning, insights from behavioural
science, and large human-generated datasets to study human behaviour in the
wild. The scientist in me does this to further knowledge; the craftsman in me,
with an eye towards helping to build great products.

In the past, I have worked on topics in political economy, health and financial
economics. In my current PhD research, I use transaction-level data to study
how people spend and save money.
